Rust Worksheet
==============

This Rust library is a sequence of explanations in code, and exercises to check
your understanding.  In each module, we address one key concept that any
beginning Rustacean should know.  In each, there may be some base code (or
there may not be!), and then several unit tests.  The unit tests are either
`test_`, which are mostly meant to be read and run, showing the concept to be
explained.  Some have "EXERCISE" in them, which asks you to uncomment
non-compiling code and make it compile (and pass!): this will help you check
if you understood the concept.  Some are `exercise_`, which will fail when run
with an explanation of what to do to make them pass. They are slightly larger
tests, sometimes integration multiple concepts.

Many parts of Rust will be immediately familiar to anyone who knows a C-syntax
language (C++, Java, etc), and so these are often introduced without
explanation.  Some different-but-not-core concepts are also introduced with
a minor comment explaining what they are.  Those aren't too critical or deep,
so just make sure you understand them enough not to be blocked by them.

Doing many of the exercises may requiring looking some things up.  Three great
resources include:

1. [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), a standard free online
   "tutorial" book that is really great.
2. [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/), a standard
   free online book that gives explicit code examples for many common patterns
   and recipes.
3. [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) is thematically similar
   to this, with lots of exercises to explore aspects of Rust.
3. The [Rust Standard Library API](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html),
   when you want a more exhaustive list of methods, types, etc.
